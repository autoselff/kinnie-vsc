### 20.12.2025
In the fallowing updates I am going to add comments, ability to print returned value and user data input system. I am also considering about adding global variables but I do not know yet weather to do so. In the future, probably in version 2.0.0, I would like to add the ability to include other .kn files to the program, a array-like data structure and of course the docs.
